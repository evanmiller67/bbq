BBQ
===

Basic info for each bbq/catering event hosted by myself. A collection of useful information will probably end up resideing in this README.

#### Yield
Generally, the weight is reduced anywhere from 30-60% from raw uncoocked weight. To be conservative and take into account bone weight, I generally say that 50% of the uncooked weight is usable (account for trimming, bone, etc.).  
<br />
This leaves you with a raw mass of cooked meat. Plan on a serving of 1/3 lb cooked weight and you get your number of servings/lb.  
<br />
End with an equation like so:
<br />
> (X lbs raw meat) = (2/3) * (Y # of servings)  

You should be able to distribute your choice of meats among any pork/beef/chicken. Doing anything with robs (pork or beef) is outside of this equation.
